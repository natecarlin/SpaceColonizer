Game Manual:
In "Space Colonizer" you play a space trading company interested in making money. The opening screen is the Galaxy Map. On the right is a map of the galaxy, with colonizable stars on display.
First thing on the left is the assets menu. Clicking here will take you to the assets page, which will display all the assets you've bought. Since you have no assets, this page is empty. Beneath
that is your net worth, which is your available capital plus the value of your assets. Below that is projected income per month, which is the aggregate return on all your assets. Next is your available capital.
You begin the game with $1000 to get you started. beneath that is the turn counter, which will move forward as you click the button below, which is the next turn button. This will bring in that month's income and
move the turn counter forward 1. To use the map, move the mouse over one of the planets. You should see a red circle and text with the name of the planet. Click on the planet to show the planet screen.
Here is where you can buy assets. At first, you can only afford a residential module or a scan, but in time (as you accrue capital) the other choices will become available to you. A scan is an asset that
returns no money, but reveals what the return will be on all module types. We recommend that you scan a few planets before you buy a residential module to get the best return on investment.
Now go out there and conquer the stars!
